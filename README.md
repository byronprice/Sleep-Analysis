# Sleep Analysis
<<<<<<< HEAD
Code for spectral analysis of single-electrode electrophysiological data during sleep.  The input data comes in a very specific format, so see the information at the top of each function for more on how to use.
=======
Code for (mostly) spectral analysis of electrophysiological and calcium-imaging data during sleep. The raw data in both cases (calcium imaging and ephys) is assumed to be saved in a very specific format and thus this code will only be applicable to such data.
