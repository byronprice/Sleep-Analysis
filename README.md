# Sleep Analysis
Code for calcium-imaging data during sleep.  The file format that must be input to Ca_im_DataStream is ave_roi.mat created through Will's data collection pipeline.  Each of the ave_roi.mat files contain a structure called roi_ave that has a number of time-series for different regions of interest (ROIs) in a calcium-imaging video. Then, Ca_im_DataStream outputs Processed_Data, which can be input into the analysis functions.
